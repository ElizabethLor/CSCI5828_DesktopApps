					<h2>History</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>IBM introduced a PC hardware platform on August 12, 1981.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The PC used a text mode command-line style operating system known as Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS).</li>
							<li>In the 1990's, the MS-DOS was replaced with the graphical Microsoft Windows Operating System.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>In 1991 and 1993, changes occurred that affected the world a great deal.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The World Wide Web (WWW) gained popularity and traction in 1991.</li>
							<li>The Mosaic web browser application was announced in 1993.</li>

					<h2>History Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Early applications were developed to be run from mainframe computers and accessed via low-tech terminal devices, but...</li>
						<li>The increase power and availability of powerful desktop computers ushered in an era of standalone desktop applications that were run locally on the PC.</li>
						<li>Additionally, the graphical user interface (GUI) was also making great strides in terms of accessibility and popularity.
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>What is a Desktop Application?</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Desktop Application?</h2>
					<p>According to PC Mag, a desktop application is "an application that runs stand alone in a desktop or laptop computer", which is contrasted with a "web-based application, which requires the Web browser to run".</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Desktop Application? Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Desktop applications run on desktop platforms whereas mobile applications run on smartphones and tablets.</li>

				<section>
					<h2>Desktop vs. Web Application</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>"Software application development began with desktop applications, which could be used on standalone machines only.</li>
						<li>Due to portability and better functions from usability point of view, web applications began to replace desktop applications.</li>
						<li>Web applications development "is usually made on client server architecture and use a web browser as the client interface.</li>

					<h2>Desktop vs. Web Applications Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Overall, deciding between web and desktop applications is now best determined by the project itselt.</li>
						<li>Both platforms have pros and cons but there is room for both at the table.</li>
						<li>The line between desktop and web apps is becoming more blurred</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Many desktop apps now use web protocols and embed web browsers</li>
							</ul>
						<li>"Reports of the death of desktop software have been greatly exaggeraged. Long-term trends have slights changed the balance in favor of the web apps for some types of products." -Andy Brice</li>

				<section><h2>Different Tools/Frameworks for Desktop Applications</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Mac Tools/Framework: XCode</h2>
					<center><img height="400" src="images/xcode.png"></center>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>XCode</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>XCode was released in 2003.</li>
						<li>It is an integrated development environment (IDE).</li>
						<li>It contains a suit of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS.</li>
						<li>Tightly integrated with Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks.</li>
						<li>XCode supports:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++</li>
							<li>Java</li>
							<li>AppleScript</li>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>Ruby</li>
							<li>Rez</li>
							<li>Swift</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>XCode Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>XCode has evolved from a programming language to a fully integrated interface</li>
						<li>Now on the Apple website the XCode interface boasts:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Assistant Editor: Splits the Xcode editor in two with code on left and the interface on the left</li>
								<li>Jump Bar: Select what information to view in the Assistant editor</li>
								<li>Interface Builder: The design canvas makes it simple to prototype a full user interface without writing code. Laying out windows, buttons, and sliders.</li>
								<li>Version Editor and Source Control: Compare two versions of the file</li>
								<li>Testing: Instant feedback to execute individual tests or group tests. </li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Mac Tools/Framework: Cocoa Framework</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cocoa Framework</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Apple's native object-oriented application programming interface (API) for the OS X operating system.</li>
						<li>It consists of the Foundation Kit, Application Kit and Core Data frameworks.</li>
						<li>Apple provides development tools such as Xcode and Interface Builder to help Cocoa Frameworks develop applications.</li>
						<li>Fun Fact: The framework was called "KidSim" before it was renamed to Cocoa.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cocoa Framework Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Cocoa and Swift</li>
							<ul>
								<li>While Cooca and Cocoa Touch still have a strong following, the release of Swift has led some developers to wonder about the future</li>
								<li>The NS Hipster wrote that, "After just a few months of working with Swift, Cocoa has begun to lose its luster...Swift is designed with modern language features that allow for safer, more performance code." </li>
							</ul>
						<li>Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are based on Objective-C but the arrival of Swift might just be the beginning of the end for Objective-C. (As the NS Hipster points out, remember Carbon?)</li>	
					</ul>
				</section>

						<li>Programmers can take advantage of robust, reliable code for all major areas of application development through the common language runtime</li>
						<li>There are two major components:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Common Language Runtime (CLR): execution engine that handles the running application</li>
							<li>.NET Framework Class Library: developers can call from their own application using the library of tested and reusable code</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>.NET Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Services that .NET Framework provides:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Version Compatibility</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Applications that are developed using a particular version of the .NET Framework that can run without modification on a later version</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Side By Side Execution</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Allow multiple versions of the common language runtime to exist on the same computer meaning that multiple versions of applications can coexist and run on the version of the .NET Framework with which it was built</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Multitargeting</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Developers can create assemblies that work on multiple .NET Framework platforms such as Windows 7 - Windows 10, Windows Phone and Xbox 360</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Since the 1990s computers have become more user-friendly with more intuitive GUIs</li>
								<li>Most users interact with their computers through applications instead of on or through the command line</li>
								<li>In order for many users to work with computers, they need desktop applications</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Browser applications such as Chrome and Firefox, make browsing the Internet much more accessible</li>

					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Desktop application engineer is also a popular position for graduating CS students - a quick look at Indeed or Monster shows how in demand these job applicants are right now</li>
						<li>Though web applications are always gaining popularity, the desktop applications can have more functionality and will not be replaced.</li>
